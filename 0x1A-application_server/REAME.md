0x1A. Application server
An application server is a modern form of platform middleware. It is system software that resides between the operating system (OS) on one side, the external resources (such as a database management system [DBMS], communications and Internet services) on another side and the users' applications on the third side.

Advantages
Provides a mechanism for dealing with all the components and running services like session management, synchronous and asynchronous client notifications.
It becomes very easy to install applications in one place.
Changing to any configuration, such as   moving the Database server, can be done centrally from one location.
Patches and security updates are easy to deploy through them.
It enables the ability to distribute requests to different servers based on their availability. This is done via Load Balancing.
It provides security to applications.
It enables fault tolerance with the ability to recover/failover recovery.
It saves big time if we are required to install a copy of configurations on each machine individually.
It supports transaction support.
When it comes to performance, the application server greatly improves application performance as it is based on the client-server model.

Types of Application Server
Application servers can be of 3 categories:

Active Application Server – This server is used to provide support and a rich environment for business logic that is involved on the server-side, which is expressed in the form of rules, components, and objects. These types of servers are also called stateful server.
Web Information Server – This type of server is used for generating pages from the database by employing HTML templates. These types of servers are also known as stateless servers.
Component Server – This software plays a primary role in providing database access to software components such as COBRA, DLL, and Java Bean. It also provides support to transaction processing requests.

Choosing the Right One
In order to choose the right one for your applications, you can start with identifying and prioritizing the requirements if the particular environment.

A few of the factors could be:

Performance
Administration
Development
Support
Compliance
Scalability
Reliability
Cost
